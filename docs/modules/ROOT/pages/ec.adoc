Conforma CLI

== Synopsis

Conforma CLI

Secure your software supply chain by validating that your artifacts meet security and 
compliance requirements. Conforma helps you verify the authenticity and integrity of 
container images, build processes, and deployment pipelines.

Whether you're ensuring images are properly signed, validating build attestations comply 
with your organization's policies, or checking that Tekton tasks follow security best 
practices, Conforma provides the tools you need to establish trust in your software 
delivery process.

Key capabilities:
• Verify signatures and attestations on container images
• Validate SLSA provenance to ensure secure build processes  
• Enforce compliance policies across your development workflow
• Generate detailed reports for audit and compliance purposes
• Support for custom validation rules to meet your specific requirements

Use Conforma to implement "trust but verify" practices in your CI/CD pipeline, 
ensuring that only secure, compliant artifacts make it to production.
