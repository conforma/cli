# Instead of using the Konflux generated pipeline PR when we create a new
# release branch application and component, let's instead copy our main branch
# pipeline and to the small modifications required to make it work. Why? Even
# though we do like to "freshen" our pipelines with the newest Konflux
# defaults, it's weird to couple that with a release branch creation. We're
# better off to change as little as possible about the pipelines compared to
# the well known and trusted main branch pipelines at this stage in the release
# workflow.
#
# Also, this is a cleaner and easier way to ensure our pipeline customizations
# (like build-args files, prefetch options, etc), are maintained, since the
# freshly generated Konflux default pipeline resets back to the default which
# wipes out the customizations.
#
# Anyway, let's give this a try. I'm doing this for the first time while setting
# up the release v0.7 branch, see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EC-1384
# and also https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EC-1165
