Next steps:

# Create the new release branch in the upstream repo
git fetch upstream
git push upstream refs/remotes/upstream/main:refs/heads/${BRANCH_NAME}

# Make your local version of the release branch
git checkout -b ${BRANCH_NAME} upstream/${BRANCH_NAME}

# Create the new application in RHTAP
Login at ${RHTAP_APPS_URL}
Create a new application by importing code from https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-cli
Set Git reference to ${BRANCH_NAME} and click "Import code"
Set the application name to ${RHTAP_APPLICATION_NAME}
Set the component name to ${RHTAP_CLI_COMPONENT_NAME}
Set Dockerfile to Dockerfile.dist
Unset the "Default build pipeline" toggle
Click "Create application"

# Wait for PR
Wait for the PR to be created
Go look at the PR in GitHub
Wait for the PR to pass the ${RHTAP_CLI_COMPONENT_NAME}-on-pull-request check
You can also watch the activity at ${RHTAP_APPS_URL}/${RHTAP_APPLICATION_NAME}/activity/pipelineruns
When it's done you can merge. (Continue to next section while you're waiting...)

# Modify EC policy config
Go to the integration tests at ${RHTAP_APPS_URL}/${RHTAP_APPLICATION_NAME}/integrationtests
Edit ${RHTAP_APPLICATION_NAME}-enterprise-contract and add a parameter as follows:
  Name: POLICY_CONFIGURATION
  Value: github.com/enterprise-contract/config//redhat-no-hermetic
Save changes

# Apply pipeline modifications
git checkout ${BRANCH_NAME}
hack/patch-pipelines.sh
Review the generated commit and then create a PR for the ${BRANCH_NAME} branch with that commit
(Todo maybe: It might be nice to include the pipeline mods in the original PR created by RHTAP.)

# Todo: What about the RPA?
