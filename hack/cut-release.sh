Next steps:

# Create the new release branch in the upstream repo
git fetch upstream
git push upstream refs/remotes/upstream/main:refs/heads/${BRANCH_NAME}

# Make your local version of the release branch
git checkout -b ${BRANCH_NAME} upstream/${BRANCH_NAME}

# Create the new application in Konflux
Login at ${KONFLUX_APPS_URL}
Create a new application by importing code from https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-cli
Set Git reference to ${BRANCH_NAME} and click "Import code"
Set the application name to ${KONFLUX_APPLICATION_NAME}
Set the component name to ${KONFLUX_CLI_COMPONENT_NAME}
Set Dockerfile to Dockerfile.dist
Unset the "Default build pipeline" toggle
Click "Create application"

# Wait for Konflux to create PR for the ec-cli component
Wait for the PR to be created
Go look at the PR in GitHub
Wait for the PR to pass the ${KONFLUX_CLI_COMPONENT_NAME}-on-pull-request check
You can also watch the activity at ${KONFLUX_APPS_URL}/${KONFLUX_APPLICATION_NAME}/activity/pipelineruns
When it's done you can merge. (Continue to next section while you're waiting...)

# Modify EC policy config
Go to the integration tests at ${KONFLUX_APPS_URL}/${KONFLUX_APPLICATION_NAME}/integrationtests
Edit ${KONFLUX_APPLICATION_NAME}-enterprise-contract and add a parameter as follows:
  Name: POLICY_CONFIGURATION
  Value: github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-cli
Save changes

# Apply cli pipeline modifications
Should be done on top of the Konflux generated PR
git checkout ${BRANCH_NAME}
hack/patch-release-pipelines.sh
hack/patch-release-pipelines.sh digest_bumps # maybe
Review the diff between the ${KONFLUX_CLI_COMPONENT_NAME}- and cli-main-ci- pipelines
Review the generated commit, and inspect the diff as described.

# Create pipeline customizations PR
With the above commit, create a PR for the ${BRANCH_NAME} branch.
(Todo maybe: If you want, try adding this commit to the PR created by Konflux before merging that PR.)

# Merge the pipeline customizations PR and create a tag
This is a bit clunky, but you need to create a tag as soon (within seconds) of the above PR being merged.
Do it like this right after merging:
  git fetch upstream && git tag ${INITIAL_TAG_NAME} upstream/${BRANCH_NAME} && git push upstream ${INITIAL_TAG_NAME}

# Todo: What about the RPA?
