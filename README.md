# `ec` a command line client for verifying artifacts and evaluating policies

The `ec` tool is used to evaluate Conforma policies for Software
Supply Chain. Various sub-commands can be used to assert facts about an artifact
such as:
  * Validating container image signature
  * Validating container image provenance
  * Evaluating [policies][pol] over the container image provenance
  * Fetching artifact authorization

Consult the [documentation][docs] for available sub-commands, descriptions and
examples of use.

## Building

Run `make build` from the root directory and use the `dist/ec` executable, or
run `make dist` to build for all supported architectures.

## Testing

Run `make test` to run the unit tests, and `make acceptance` to run the
acceptance tests.

## Linting

Run `make lint` to check for linting issues, and `make lint-fix` to fix linting
issues (formatting, import order, ...).

## Demo

Run `hack/demo.sh` to evaluate the policy against images that have been
built ahead of time.

To regenerate those images, say in case of change in the attestation data, run
`hack/rebuild.sh`.

## Troubleshooting

The `--debug` parameter enables debug logging. Setting `EC_DEBUG` environment
variable can be set to prevent deletion of temporary `ec-work-*` directories so
that the attestations, policy and data files can be examined.

#### **1. Go Module Checksum Mismatch Error**

When downloading dependencies, you might encounter a checksum mismatch error like this:
```
go: downloading github.com/googleapis/enterprise-certificate-proxy v0.3.3
verifying github.com/googleapis/enterprise-certificate-proxy@v0.3.3: checksum mismatch
        downloaded: h1:G6q7VHBoU74wQHXFsZSLMPl0rFw0ZDrlZ3rt6/aTBII=
        go.sum:     h1:QRje2j5GZimBzlbhGA2V2QlGNgL8G6e+wGo/+/2bWI0=
```

This issue may be resolved by running the following command to set the Go proxy, which helps resolve checksum mismatches:
``` bash
$ go env -w GOPROXY='https://proxy.golang.org,direct'
```

#### **2. Docker Container Start Failures in Acceptance Tests**

#### **2.1 Variety of issues - podman running as a system service**

Various issues may arise from the Podman service and socket running as system services rather than user services (i.e. rootful instead of rootless).
Before attempting any other solutions, ensure that the Podman system service and socket are stopped and disabled.
On Red Hat or Fedora systems, you can do this by executing the following commands (note: other systems may require modifications):

```bash
$ systemctl status podman.socket podman.service
$ systemctl disable --now podman.socket podman.service
```

It is advised to do a reboot afterwards.

To start Podman for the user:

``` bash
$ systemctl enable --user --now podman.socket podman.service
```

#### **2.2. Get localhost:37837: connection reset by peer**

When running acceptance tests you may experience issues with starting enough Docker containers to successfully complete testing. These issues may appear as repeated failures, such as seen below, and a failed acceptance test run.

```
time="2024-03-08T09:10:50-05:00" level=warning msg="Failed, retrying in 1s ... (3/3). Error: trying to reuse blob sha256:b5976a979c30628edfeee0a1f1797362b0c84cf6cb4760776aa64ec8e3e4c2b3 at destination: pinging container registry localhost:37837: Get \"http://localhost:37837/v2/\": read tcp 127.0.0.1:34090->127.0.0.1:37837: read: connection reset by peer"
```

This issue may be resolved by increasing the total number of `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` by executing the following on: Red Hat / Fedora systems (other systems may need modifications to this)
``` bash
$ echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

##### **2.3. Create keyring: Disk quota exceeded**
```
FAIL: TestFeatures/valid_policy_URL (1.23s)
suite.go:634: start container: container start: Error response from daemon: crun: create keyring `ab949bcc7a6f13272c70c2252e2843f8fb4376e1446fc330333d571e924feee4`: Disk quota exceeded: OCI runtime error
```

The maximum number of keys that a nonroot user may own is defined in `kernel.keys.maxkeys`. The default value is 200.
This issue may be resolved by increasing the total number of keys by executing the following on: Red Hat / Fedora systems (other systems may need modifications to this)
``` bash
$ echo kernel.keys.maxkeys=1000 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

#### **3. Apiserver and Rekor Host Resolution Failure**

While running the acceptance tests, you might encounter issues related to apiserver and rekor hosts, like:
```
+ Error: unable to fetch EnterpriseContractPolicy: Get "http://apiserver.localhost:32971/apis/appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1/namespaces/acceptance/enterprisecontractpolicies/mismatched-image-digest": dial tcp: lookup apiserver.localhost on 127.0.0.1:53: no such host

Post \"${REKOR}/api/v1/log/entries/retrieve\": POST ${REKOR}/api/v1/log/entries/retrieve giving up after 4 attempt(s): Post \"${REKOR}/api/v1/log/entries/retrieve\": dial tcp: lookup rekor.localhost on 127.0.0.1:53: no such host
```

This issue may be resolved by adding the below entries in the `/etc/hosts` file:
```
127.0.0.1 apiserver.localhost
127.0.0.1 rekor.localhost
```

This issue arises because the acceptance tests use ec binaries built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`. This setting, [chosen for OS compatibility](https://github.com/conforma/cli/pull/703), causes the program to use Go's native DNS resolver instead of the system's libc resolver ([learn more](https://go.dev/doc/go1.5#net)). Consequently, the binary is unable to resolve 2nd level localhost domains like `apiserver.localhost`, as the native Go DNS resolver does not support resolution for such names in the same way the system resolver does.
